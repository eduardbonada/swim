WHAT INFO DO I HAVE?
********************
- Session
	date/hour						time	distance

- Set
	date			order in session	style	time	distance	strokes	     rest before	rest after

- Length
	date	order in set	order in session	style	time	distance	strokes


GLOBAL SESSIONS
***************

Best SESSION pace ever?

[DONE] Evolution of SESSION pace? (done assuming sessions in different days)

[DISCARD] Evolution of SESSION time? I show pace and distance evolutions, do I need time?

[DONE] Evolution of SESSION distance? (done assuming sessions in different days)

[DONE] Structure of SESSION? styles, set distances, set times
	[DISCARDED]- By set time: Stacked bar plot (coloured styles) with set time as y and date as x
	[DONE] - By set distance: Stacked bar plot (coloured styles) with set distance as y and date as x

Effect of the moment of the day swimming over the distance/time/pace of the SESSION?
	- scatter plot: x is hour, y is pace, color is distance, (color is time, size is distance)


GLOBAL SETS
***********

[DONE] Best SET time ever of all possible set lengths and all possible styles? When?

[DONE] Evolution of SET time (all set times)?

==> [DOING] Evolution of SET time (only top set times)?

[DONE] Relationship between pace and strokes.
	- scatter plot: x is strokes/100m, y is pace, color/size is distance (color is time, size is distance)

[DONE] Effect of the moment of the day over the distance/time/pace of the SET?
	- scatter plot: x is hour, y is pace, color/size is distance (color is time, size is distance)

Relationship between previous prev_rest|after_rest and pace/time/distance
	- scatter plot: x is prev_rest|after_rest, y is pace, color/size is distance (color is time, size is distance)

Virtual best SET?
	- (Only for short sets to avoid combinations) 100m FREE, 100m BREAST, ...

histograms of time, strokes, ... (semetithing more statistical...)



SINGLE SESSION
**************
(to have something to evaluate after each session)

How does a single session compare to the rest? 



SINGLE SET
**********
Style, time, strokes and distance
